# Generate `ImageCell.abi.json`

API is generated by [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/writing-and-compiling-contracts).

```
cd ../contract
yarn
npx hardhat compile
```

Then you will find that ABI is in file `../contract/artifacts/contracts/ImageCell.sol/ImageCell.json`. Find the key `abi` and copy its value to file `ImageCell.abi.json`.

# Generate `image_cell_abi.rs`

`image_cell_abi.rs` is generated by [ethers](https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/blob/master/examples/abigen.rs).
