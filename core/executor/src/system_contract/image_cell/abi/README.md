# Generate `image_cell_abi.json`

Ethereum contract ABI is generated by [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/writing-and-compiling-contracts).

```
cd ../contract
yarn
npx hardhat compile
```

Then you will find that ABI is in file `artifacts/contracts/ImageCell.sol/ImageCell.json`. Find the key `abi` and copy its value to file `image_cell_abi.json`.

# Generate `image_cell_abi.rs`

`image_cell_abi.rs` is generated by [abigen macro](https://docs.rs/ethers-contract/0.2.2/ethers_contract/macro.abigen.html) or the [Abigen builder](https://docs.rs/ethers-contract/0.2.2/ethers_contract/macro.abigen.html), and they can both accept `image_cell_abi.json` as input.
